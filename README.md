I'm an Undergrad Senior who is passionate about making open-source more accessible to the beginners in this field. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Computer Vision (Tensorflow and Keras), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Django (Python).
I am currently working on detecting Lung cancer cells from Histopathological images.
